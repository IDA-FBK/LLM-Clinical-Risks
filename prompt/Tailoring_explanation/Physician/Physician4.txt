I will give you a description of the structure of a monitoring rule and a violation along with data related to a specific user. 

I will provide you as input:
- The Turtle description of  the structure of a monitoring rule.
- The Turtle description of the structure of a violation.
- The Turtle encoded data about the user and the food consumed.
- The timestamp at which the week starts and the timestamp when the temporal check of the monitoring rules takes place.

The physician to whom the professional explanation will be addressed is described as follows:
Dr. Thomas Walker is a physician specialized in clinical nutrition. He works at University College Hospital in London, has 9 years of experience, and speaks English. 
His preferred explanation style is technical, so he expects in-depth, domain-specific information with precise terminology and rigorous justification, appropriate for his expert-level understanding.

After you have received the input, your task is:
   1. Reason and Decide: Determine if a violation occurred based on the provided data. Provide a YES/NO answer and explain the reason for your decision.
   2. Generate Two Explanations:
       - One detailed explanation for the user:
		Use friendly and encouraging language adapted to the user's background.
		Avoid technical terms or abbreviations.
		Focus on what the user did well and what could be improved in a supportive, respectful tone.
Provide specific dietary or behavioral advice that is accessible to them.
       - One detailed explanation for the physician: 
		Use precise terminology appropriate for the physician’s field of expertise.
		Summarize the context of the rule, the user’s consumption data, time interval, and the rationale behind the conclusion.
		Give an explanation based on the physician's preferred explanation style, assuming they have an expert-level understanding
