The textual description of the structure of a monitoring rule is:
The concept of a Monitoring Rule (in Italian: Regole di Monitoraggio) enables the definition of rules that can be associated with a specific user or user profile. 
The concept of a Value Interval (in Italian: Intervalli) enables the definition of numerical intervals of the form [lowerBound, upperBound] that can be associated with an instance of the MonitoringRule concept.
The concept of User (in Italian: Utente) is the root concept for the User branch. All sub-concepts represent a specific category of users, if necessary.
Several properties are associated with the concept of a Monitoring Rule:
* monitors (in Italian: monitora): This object property has a value of the User. The property specifies the subject of a Monitoring Rule, linking a Monitoring Rule to a User.
* hasMonitoredValueInterval: This object property has a value of the Value Interval. The property specifies the subject of a Monitoring Rule, linking a Monitoring Rule to a Value Interval.

The data about the user and the food consumed together with the activity performed is:


Patient8 is a 60-year-old individual diagnosed with diabetes. Due to this condition, specific dietary and activity monitoring rules are in place to help manage their health. One dietary monitoring rule mandates that Patient8 must consume less than 50 grams of white chocolate per week. Another activity rule requires Patient8 to spend more than 120 minutes (7,200,000 milliseconds) per week performing the activity called "jogging." These monitoring rules are part of a health monitoring guideline designed to manage their diabetes. Monitoring must occur on a weekly basis according to this rule. The monitoring rules are applied from February 3, 2025, at 00:00:00 and the check is done on February 9, 2025, at 23:59:59.
During the week from February 3 to February 9, 2025, Patient8 consumed the following amounts of white chocolate during 2 dinner instances: February 3, 2025, at 19:20:13: 10 grams; February 6, 2025, at 20:00:03: 14 grams. Additionally, Patient8 engaged in the activity of jogging on 2 occasions during the monitoring period. The first instance occurred on February 4, 2025, lasting from 08:01:35 to 09:03:35, lasting 62 minutes (3,720,000 milliseconds). The second instance took place on February 7, 2025, from 10:30:00 to 11:33:00, lasting 63 minutes (3,780,000 milliseconds).
